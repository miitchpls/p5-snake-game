# Snake game

My version of the renowned Snake game, coded in JavaScript and implemented with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. It represents a small project from my past, where I played a bit for improving my understanding of JavaScript and initiated experimentation with libraries.

## Installation

The project doesn't require any installation, you can just close the repository and open the index.html file.

## Demo

A demo can be found [here](https://www.miitchpls.it/snake/). ðŸ˜Š
