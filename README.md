# Snake game

A small project I worked on in the past to improve my understanding of JavaScript and to start playing around with some libraries, in this case, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

This is my version of the renowned Snake game, coded in JavaScript and implemented with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. It represents a small project from my past, where I delved into enhancing my understanding of JavaScript and initiated experimentation with libraries.
